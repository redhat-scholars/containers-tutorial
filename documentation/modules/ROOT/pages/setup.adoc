== Required Tools

The following tools are required for running the exercises in this tutorial. You'll need to have them installed and configured before you get started with any of the tutorial chapters.

TIP: By default, the commands in this tutorial are using Docker, but you use `podman` instead of `docker` throughout the tutorial's instructions, or `alias docker=podman`. The advantage of Podman is that it is 100% Free Open Source and does not need to run with elevated privileges.
