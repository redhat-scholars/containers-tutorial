= Port

The application running inside your container can be accessed through the port 8080, so let's try it:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl localhost:8080/hello
----

You should have gotten this output:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8080: Connection refused
----

This is happening because we need to explicitly expose the ports you need, and we didn't do it so far. So let's fix it.

First let's remove the container:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker rm -f my-container
----

[TIP]
====
Did you see something different?

We used the `-f` flag to force the removal of the container even if it's running. Be careful when using it! 
====

Now we re-create the container, but exposing the port 8080:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker run -d --name my-container -p 8080:8080 my-image
----

Let's try to reach the application again:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl localhost:8080/hello
----

You now got this output:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
hello
----

Meaning that your application is now accessible.
