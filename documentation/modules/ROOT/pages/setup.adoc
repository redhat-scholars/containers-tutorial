== Required Tools

The following tools are required for running the exercises in this tutorial. You'll need to have them installed and configured before you get started with any of the tutorial chapters.

TIP: By default, the commands in this tutorial are using podman, but you can use `docker` instead of `podman` throughout the tutorial's instructions as the commands will be identical (eg. `podman run` will be the same as `docker run`). The advantage of Podman is that it is 100% Free Open Source and does not need to run with elevated privileges.
