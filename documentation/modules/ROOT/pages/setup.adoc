== Required Tools

The following tools are required for running the exercises in this tutorial. You'll need to have them installed and configured before you get started with any of the tutorial chapters.

TIP: By default, the commands in this tutorial are using podman, but you can use `docker` instead of `podman` throughout the tutorial's instructions as the commands will be identical (eg. `podman run` will be the same as `docker run`). The advantage of Podman is that it is 100% Free Open Source and does not need to run with elevated privileges.

== Quay.io Account

**Quay.io** is a **container image registry** service, similar to _Docker Hub_, which is fully managed by Red Hat. It provides a centralized, secure place for users and organizations to store, build, and distribute their OCI (Open Container Initiative) container images.

NOTE: If you already have a _Quay.io_ account or a _Docker Hub_ account, you can skip this section.

=== Creating a Quay.io Account

A Quay.io account is typically linked to a **Red Hat account**.

.  *Navigate to Quay.io*: Go to the Quay.io website.
.  *Sign In/Register*: Look for a *Sign In* or *Register* option. Since Quay.io is part of Red Hat's ecosystem, you'll be directed to use your Red Hat credentials.
      * If you *already have a Red Hat account*, sign in with those credentials.
      * If you *do not have a Red Hat account*, you'll be prompted to create one first. Follow the prompts to register for a new Red Hat account.
.  *Confirm Username*: Upon your first login to Quay.io using your Red Hat credentials, you may be redirected to a page to *confirm your username*. This username will serve as your *namespace* (e.g., `quay.io/<your-username>/<repo-name>`) in the container registry.

=== Creating a Repository

A repository is a storage location for your container images and related artifacts: think of it as a folder or directory for a specific containerized application or component.

.  *Log In*: Sign in to your Quay.io account.
.  *Navigate to Repositories*: On your main page, or in the navigation menu, look for a *Repositories* section or a *+* icon (or a *Create Repository* button).
.  *Select Repository Type*: Choose *Container Image Repository* (or similar option, if prompted).
.  *Enter Details*:
      * *Namespace*: Select your username (or an Organization you belong to).
      * *Repository Name*: Enter a name for your repository (e.g., `my-first-app`). *Avoid* using names like `build`, `trigger`, `tag`, or `notification` as they can cause access and deletion issues.
.  *Visibility*: Choose the *Repository Visibility*:
      * *Public*: Anyone can pull this image (free tier typically allows unlimited public repositories).
      * *Private*: Only you and users/teams you explicitly grant access to can pull this image (usually limited/paid in the free tier).
.  *Create*: Click the *Create Repository* button. The repository will now appear in your list, ready to receive images.

=== Creating a robot account

A good practice is to create a robot account to be used for automation purposes and to avoid accidental leaks of credentials.

. Once you have logged in, in the top right corner click on your username and *navigate* to the _Account Settings_ page.
. In the left vertical menu select the *Robot Accounts* icon to open the releated tab.
. Click on the *Create Robot Account* button.
. Enter a name for the robot account and click on the *Create* button.
. The next screen will propose you to *add permissions* to the robot account. You can choose to add permissions to a specific repository or to all repositories.
  .. Make sure to select the *Write* permission to use it for pushing images to the repository.
  .. Click on the *Add permissions* button.
. The robot account will now appear in your list, ready to be used.

NOTE: The robot account takes the following format: `<username>+<robot-account-name>`.
