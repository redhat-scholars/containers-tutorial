= Image Management

An image can be used to create and run containers. It is like a template, containing instructions on how to build the container. Images are the starting point for any container related activity, and can be thought of as a snapshot in a virtual machine (VM) environment.

== Building an image based on a Dockerfile

With the Dockerfile that we created in the last step, let's build a container image:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker build -t my-image .
----

You'll see an output like this:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----

== Listing the available images

To see your just created image, just run:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker image list
----

You'll see at least these two outputs:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
REPOSITORY                                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
my-image                                     latest              87776d35fc85        4 minutes ago       516MB
registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11   latest              e502114b0d20        2 months ago        505MB
----

Your image is the `my-image` and the `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11` is the image used to build yours.

== Removing images

To remove your just created image:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker image rm my-image
----

// == Exploring the Desktop interfaces

// Let's take a look at image management in the Desktop interfaces.

// [tabs]
// ====
// Docker Desktop::
// +
// --
// Using Docker Desktop, we can see our newly created image in the *Images* tab. Here, we have information about the newly created image, including the the image ID, tag, creation date, and size of the image. Let's select the image name to see more information about the image.

// image::docker-desktop-images.png[alt="Docker Desktop Images tab", align="center"]

// Here, we see information about the image hierarchy, as well as the various layers added, any vulnerabilities that may exist, and packages added.

// image::docker-desktop-image-info.png[alt="Docker Desktop Image Info tab", align="center"]

// Returning back to the Images tab, we could also use the *Hub* tab to see our images that have been published to Docker Hub.

// image::docker-desktop-hub.png[alt="Docker Desktop Hub tab", align="center"]
// --
// Podman Desktop::
// +
// --
// With Podman Desktop, we can see our newly created image in the *Images* tab. Here, we have information about the newly created image, including the the image ID, tag, creation date, and size of the image. Let's select the image name to see more information about the image.

// image::podman-desktop-images.png[alt="Podman Desktop Images tab", align="center"]

// Here, we see information about the image layers, and low-level information about the image in JSON format.
